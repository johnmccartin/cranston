							<p class="content-text-small"><span class="highlight-gray">Dexter Park was used as a military training ground even before the Cranston Street Armory was built. In the Civil War, the first African-American heavy artillery unit, the 14th Regiment Rhode Island, was trained at the Dexter Training Grounds. In fact, Rhode Island led the charge to allow black men to fight for the Union in the Civil War. This was the continuation of a legacy of African-American military service in Rhode Island, which began with the nationâ€™s first mixed-race military regiment in the Revolutionary War, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. This regiment participated in the Battle of Yorktown, Virginia, which led to British surrender and the end of the war.</span></p>
