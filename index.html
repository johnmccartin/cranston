						<h1>Cranston Street Armory <br />Reuse Plan</h1>

						
						<div class="larger-text">
                            <p>The State of Rhode Island’s Department of Administration has received two proposals for the development and renovation of the Cranston Street Armory, in response to a solicitation for proposals that was issued on March 17, 2020. Both submissions propose a range of uses, including a strategy for including local businesses and nonprofits in the mix; a vision for the renovation of the historic structure; and a plan for allowing public access to spaces in the building. A three year community process informed the submission requirements and selection criteria, as spelled out in the request for proposals. The proposals are generally responsive to these community priorities.</p>

							<p>The two teams will present their proposals and field questions at two duplicate virtual public meetings scheduled on two days and different times of the day to encourage people with different daily schedules to attend one of the meetings. Both meetings will follow the same format and will include pre-recorded presentations by both project proponents, along with opportunities for attendees to ask the proponents questions. The meetings will also be recorded and posted on the Cranston Street Armory website, along with a feedback form to allow members of the public to submit additional comments.</p>

							<p>The first meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, October 13th between 3-5pm. The second meeting will be held on Thursday, October 15th between 5-7pm.</p>
                                
                                Stay tuned for updates!

						<p class="content-text-small"><span class="highlight-gray">Dexter Park was used as a military training ground even before the Cranston Street Armory was built. In the Civil War, the first African-American heavy artillery unit, the 14th Regiment Rhode Island, was trained at the Dexter Training Grounds. In fact, Rhode Island led the charge to allow black men to fight for the Union in the Civil War. This was the continuation of a legacy of African-American military service in Rhode Island, which began with the nation’s first mixed-race military regiment in the Revolutionary War, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. This regiment participated in the Battle of Yorktown, Virginia, which led to British surrender and the end of the war.</span></p>
